## Service Descriptions (from homepage body):

### Window Cleaning:
The interior of the window we use the traditional sponge to loosen up dirt and a squeegee to wipe every window clean. For the exterior we use water-fed poles attached to a water purifier tank which doesnâ€™t require soap but leaves a spot-free finish on the exterior of every single window, Restoring to curb appeal.

### Gutter Cleaning:
Our gutter cleaning process is very simple we simply prop a ladder against a stable contact point and work our way down every gutter using our hands and a scooper clearing them of all debris so water can flow freely.

### Pressure Washing:
We pressure wash using a high-pressure water spray to remove any dirt, grime, mold, and other debris from any outdoor surfaces. This process is quick, efficient, and ideal for tough stains, restoring the surface to its original cleanliness.
